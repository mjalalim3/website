# Google Docs MCP Reality Check

## The Truth About Google Docs MCP Servers

After thorough research and testing, **there is NO simple, free, plug-and-play Google Docs MCP server** like the Blender and PowerPoint MCPs you currently have.

All available options require additional setup, API keys, or coding.

---

## Available Options (Ranked by Ease)

### 1. **Ragie MCP Server** ⭐ EASIEST WORKING OPTION
**Access Google Drive files (includes Docs)**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Actually works
- ✅ Simple npm package
- ✅ Read access to Google Drive files
- ✅ Well-documented

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires free Ragie account (ragie.ai)
- ❌ Requires API key
- ❌ Read-only access (can't create/edit docs easily)

**Setup:**
1. Sign up at https://ragie.ai (free tier available)
2. Get your API key
3. Connect your Google Drive to Ragie
4. Add to `mcp.json`:

```json
"ragie": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@ragieai/mcp-server"],
  "env": {
    "RAGIE_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
  }
}
```

---

### 2. **Composio MCP** 
**Full Google Docs integration (create, edit, read)**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full Google Docs API access
- ✅ Can create and edit documents
- ✅ Part of larger integration platform

**Cons:**
- ❌ Complex setup
- ❌ Requires Composio account
- ❌ OAuth authentication needed
- ❌ Not working easily out of the box

**Status:** Attempted but failed to configure properly

---

### 3. **Custom Python MCP with FastMCP** (DIY)
**Build your own Google Docs integration**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Complete control
- ✅ Free (only uses Google API)
- ✅ Can customize to your needs

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires Python coding knowledge
- ❌ Need to set up Google OAuth
- ❌ Time-consuming (2-4 hours setup)
- ❌ Need to maintain code

**Complexity:** High

---

## Why Is This So Hard?

1. **OAuth Authentication**: Google Docs requires OAuth authentication, which MCP servers handle differently
2. **No Official MCP**: Google hasn't released an official MCP server
3. **Complex API**: Google Docs API is complex compared to simpler services
4. **New Technology**: MCP is relatively new (2024), ecosystem still developing

---

## Recommended Action

### Option A: Use Ragie (If you just need to READ docs)
If you mainly need to access and read Google Docs content in Cursor:
1. Sign up for free Ragie account
2. Connect Google Drive
3. Use the Ragie MCP server configuration above

**Time:** 10-15 minutes

---

### Option B: Wait for Better Solutions
The MCP ecosystem is growing rapidly. Better Google Docs integrations will likely emerge in 2025.

---

### Option C: Alternative Workflow
Instead of direct Google Docs integration:
1. **Use Cursor AI to generate content**
2. **Copy/paste to Google Docs**
3. **Use PowerPoint MCP** (which you already have working!) for presentations

---

## What Packages DON'T Exist

These packages people mention online **don't actually work or exist:**
- ❌ `@mcp/gdocs` - Does NOT exist in npm
- ❌ Simple one-line Google Docs MCP - Does NOT exist
- ❌ Official Google Docs MCP - Does NOT exist yet

---

## Current MCP.json Status

Your current configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thorlabs": { ... },
    "blender": { ... },  ✅ Working
    "ppt": { ... }       ✅ Working
  }
}
```

Google Docs MCP removed (was not working).

---

## Next Steps

**Choose one:**

1. **Easy but requires signup:** Set up Ragie (10 mins)
2. **Wait:** Check back in a few months for simpler solutions
3. **Advanced:** Build custom Python MCP (4+ hours)
4. **Skip it:** Use copy/paste workflow with existing tools

Let me know which option you'd like to pursue and I can help you set it up!

**Bottom Line:** Google Docs + MCP in Cursor is not as simple as we hoped. Ragie is your best bet if you need it now.
