# Research Overview

My research focuses on cutting-edge quantum photonics and topological photonic circuits, with particular emphasis on semiconductor-based quantum systems and their applications in quantum technologies.

## Current Research Areas

### 1. Topological Photonic Circuits

My work on semiconductor topological quantum photonic integrated circuits represents a significant advancement in quantum photonics. These circuits enable the generation, transfer, and manipulation of light at the single photon limit on-chip.

**Key Achievement:** This work was recognized with the UK's Rank Prize Award in 2021.
