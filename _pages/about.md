# About me

Hello! I'm Mahmoud Jalali Mehrabad, a Research Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I received my PhD in quantum optics as a University Prize Scholarship Fellow from the University of Sheffield, UK, in 2021, under the supervision of Profs. Maurice Skolnick, Mark Fox, and Luke Wilson.

My PhD research focused on developing semiconductor topological quantum photonic integrated circuits for generation, transfer, and manipulation of light at the single‑photon limit on‑chip, for which I was awarded the UK's Rank Prize Award in 2021. I joined the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland in 2022 to work in Prof. Mohammad Hafezi’s lab, and now continue my research at MIT.

You can read more about my current projects on the [Research](/research/) page and find an up‑to‑date list of my publications on the [Publications](/publications/) page. A selection of project snapshots is on the [Portfolio](/portfolio/) page.
