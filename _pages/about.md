# About me

Hello! I'm Mahmoud Jalali Mehrabad, a Research Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I received my PhD in quantum optics as a University Prize Scholarship Fellow from the University of Sheffield, UK, in 2021, under the supervision of Profs. Maurice Skolnick, Mark Fox, and Luke Wilson.

My PhD research focused on developing semiconductor topological quantum photonic integrated circuits, for the generation, transfer, and manipulation of light at the single photon limit on-chip, for which I was awarded the UK's Rank Prize Award in 2021. I joined the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland in 2022 to work in Prof. Hafezi's Lab, and now continue my research at MIT.

## Research Focus

My current research encompasses several cutting-edge areas in quantum photonics:

- **Topological Photonic Circuits:** Development of semiconductor topological quantum photonic integrated circuits
- **Quantum Frequency Combs:** Generation and manipulation of optical frequency combs on topological silicon nitride
- **On-chip Synchronization:** Multi-timescale optical synchronization and frequency-phase matching
- **Chiral Quantum Optics:** On-chip chiral quantum optics with solid-state quantum emitters
- **2D Materials Integration:** 2D-materials-integrated plasmonics for advanced photonic applications

## Education

- **Ph.D.** in Quantum Optics, University of Sheffield, UK, 2021
- **University Prize Scholarship Fellow** (2017-2021)

## Current Research at MIT

My current work focuses on:

- **Quantum Photonic Integrated Circuits:** Advanced semiconductor-based quantum systems
- **Optical Frequency Combs:** Novel approaches to frequency comb generation and manipulation
- **Quantum Synchronization:** On-chip optical synchronization techniques
- **Solid-state Quantum Emitters:** Integration with nanophotonic structures
- **2D Materials Photonics:** Advanced plasmonic and photonic applications

## Awards and Recognition

- **UK Rank Prize Award** (2021) - For work on semiconductor topological quantum photonic integrated circuits
- **University Prize Scholarship Fellow** (2017-2021) - University of Sheffield
