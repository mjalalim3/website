# About me

Hello! I'm Mahmoud Jalali Mehrabad, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), working with Prof. Dirk Englund in the [Quantum Photonics & AI Group](https://qp.mit.edu/team). I am passionate about advancing quantum technologies through innovative research in semiconductor and optical systems.

My research spans a wide array of topics, from quantum photonics and optical computing to quantum sensing and semiconductor integration. I enjoy collaborating with scientists from diverse fields, bringing together theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to tackle complex problems in quantum technologies and photonics. You can read more about my research [here](/research/) and find an up-to-date list of my publications [here](/publications/).
