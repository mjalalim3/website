# About me

Hello! I'm Mahmoud Jalali Mehrabad, a Research Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I received my PhD in quantum optics as a University Prize Scholarship Fellow from the University of Sheffield, UK, in 2021, under the supervision of Profs. Maurice Skolnick, Mark Fox, and Luke Wilson.

My PhD research focused on developing semiconductor topological quantum photonic integrated circuits, for the generation, transfer, and manipulation of light at the single photon limit on-chip, for which I was awarded the UK's Rank Prize Award in 2021. I joined the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland in 2022 to work in Prof. Hafezi's Lab, and now continue my research at MIT.

My current research encompasses quantum photonics, topological photonic circuits, optical frequency combs, on-chip quantum synchronization, chiral quantum optics with solid-state quantum emitters, and 2D-materials-integrated plasmonics. You can find an up-to-date list of my publications [here](/publications/) and learn more about my research projects [here](/portfolio/).
