## About me

Hello! I'm Mahmoud Jalali Mehrabad, a Research Scientist at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://web.mit.edu/), working with [Prof. Marin Soljačić](https://www.rle.mit.edu/soljacic/). I am also a member of the [MIT Quantum Photonics Group](https://qp.mit.edu/team). I earned my PhD in Quantum Optics from the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) in 2021, where I was a University Prize Scholarship Fellow under the supervision of Profs. Maurice Skolnick, Mark Fox, and Luke Wilson.

My research spans quantum photonics, topological photonic circuits, optical frequency combs, on-chip quantum synchronization, chiral quantum optics with solid-state quantum emitters, and 2D-materials-integrated plasmonics. My PhD work on semiconductor topological quantum photonic integrated circuits was recognized with the UK's [Rank Prize Award](https://www.rankprize.org/) in 2021. You can read more about my research [here](/research/) and find an up-to-date list of my publications [here](/publications/).
