3. **File name**: `profile.jpg` or `profile.png`
4. **Format**: JPG or PNG

## Your Photo:
Based on your description, you have a professional black and white headshot that would be perfect for your academic website. Please:

1. **Download your photo** from your device
2. **Rename it** to `profile.jpg`
3. **Place it** in this `images` folder
4. **Upload the updated folder** to GitHub

## The website will automatically use this photo as your profile picture!

If you don't have the photo ready, the website will work without it, but adding your professional headshot will make it look much more professional and personal.
