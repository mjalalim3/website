Mahmoud Jalali Mehrabad

Research Scientist | MIT

Mahmoud Jalali Mehrabad received his PhD in quantum optics as a University Prize Scholarship Fellow from the University of Sheffield, UK, in 2021, under the supervision of Profs. Maurice Skolnick, Mark Fox, and Luke Wilson. His PhD was focused on developing semiconductor topological quantum photonic integrated circuits, for the generation, transfer, and manipulation of light at the single photon limit on-chip, for which he was awarded the UKâ€™s Rank Prize Award in 2021. He joined the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland in 2022 to work in Prof. Hafezi's Lab. His postdoc work is focused on the generation and manipulation of a new class of optical frequency combs on topological silicon nitride, on-chip multi-timescale optical synchronziation and frequency-phase matching, on-chip chiral quantum optics with solid-state quantum emitters, and 2D-materials-integrated plasmonics.
